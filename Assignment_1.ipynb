    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Expression is something that represents or derives a value from it and could be part of a statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in below a=10 could be a statement that assigns value of the expression 10. While b=a*10 could be treated as statement where a*10 is stated as expresssion that represents or derives the value 100 for b using operator * and variable a and expression value 10. So any expression even it has combination of multiple things like operators, variables etc. finally it evaluates to a single value.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here spam = 10 represents a assignment statement or a declaration which is treated as instruction which utilises an expression to be evaluated by python interpreter to some value and store it under a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, below statement sets an instruction by Python interpreter to evaluate the expression value to 10 and store under spam variable where as the if statement is a comparision statement which contains expressions that evaluates to True. So declaration can be used to declare and use expressions to evaluate to a value and store it where as expressions are used across different types of statements to get evaluated to some value based on the context.\n",

So if we need to change the value of a variable then we need perform again an assignment statement as below so that new memory location would be created and assigned to baacon variable which contains the new value, but in above we trying to update in the same location which is not allowed by Python Interpreter due to immutability behaviour.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, variable name can contain aplhanumeric characters and underscore character of any length, but cannot start with a digit. So 100 could not be a valid variable name as it starts with a digit and eggs is a true variable name as it starts with a alphabet character.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "int() converts a value to an integer if the value contains only digits without decimal values. If decimal values are present it should first converted to float using float() and then use int() to convert to integer value but decimal places would be removed from the value.\n",
    "\n",

    "float() is used to convert a value to floating number, in case if a integer value is passed it converts it into decimal value by adding \".0' as suffix. If any value is passed other than digits python interpreter would throw a valuerror.\n",
