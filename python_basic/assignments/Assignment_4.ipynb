    "spam[:2] = ['a', 'b'], this is because list[start:stop:step] here start is not mentioned so starts from first index and stop resolves to index 2 which is excluded and so it would select starting from first value to one before stop index it will be selected.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They themselves are another variables based on the data type of the list value. Below example illustrates that index 1 of a is assigned to b, now type of b is not list rather it is integer. Later tried to update the the list a at index 1 but b values dooesn't change because it itself is a separate variable created with int datatype\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "copy.copy() just takes the memory location of the variable been assigned but copy.deepcopy() would create a separate memory location for new variable and has its own copy. So in deepcopy even if the paarent variable is updated child variable doesn't get updated. Below example illustrates the same behaviour where id of c would be different from d but values id would be same in copy.copy() while both d id and values of d id as well is different in deepcopy.\n",
