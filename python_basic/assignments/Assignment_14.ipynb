    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs often represent a color in an image as an RGBA value. An RGBA value is a group of numbers that specify the amount of red, green, blue, and alpha (or transparency) in a color. Each of these component values is an integer from 0 (none at all) to 255 (the maximum)\n",

    "2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",

    "We can use image object getdata() function to all rgba values of an image.\n",

    "3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of Pillow’s functions and methods take a box tuple argument. This means Pillow is expecting a tuple of four integer coordinates that represent a rectangular region in an image.\n",
    "\n",

    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "a = Image.open('abc.png')\n",
    "a.size    #(816, 1088)  here width is 816 and height is 1088\n",

    "5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "abc = Image.new('RGBA', (100, 100), 'green')\n",

    "Using save method as below.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageDraw module contains code to draw on images.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle(). They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function.\n"
