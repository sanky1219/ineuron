    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PdfFileReader() should be opened in read-binary mode(rb) whereas PdfFileWriter() file object should be opened in write-binary(wb) mode using open function in stream argument.\n",

    "2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PdfFileReder.getPage(pageNumber) is used to get the specific page number.\n",

    "3. What PdfFileReader variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pdfReader.numPages is used to get number of pages in pdf document, it internlly accesses getNumPages() function to store the value. \n",
    "4. If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish, what must you do before you can obtain Page objects from it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to use decrypt method of PdfFileReader class to open that file\n",

    "6. What is the difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Document object contains a list of Paragraph objects for the paragraphs in the word document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses ENTER or RETURN while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "7. How do you obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object that’s stored in a variable named doc?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "we can use doc.paragraphs[<index] which is of type list to get the specific paragraph or we can use for loop and iterate through doc.paragraphs\n",

    "\n",
    "8. What type of object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between False, True, and None for the bold variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Runs can be further styled using text attributes. Each attribute can be set to one of three values: True (the attribute is always enabled, no matter what other styles are applied to the run), False (the attribute is always disabled), or None (defaults to whatever the run’s style is set to).\n",
