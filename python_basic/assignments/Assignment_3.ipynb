    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are advantageous because we can create once and reuse them at multiple places whereever required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is basically registered when we run its specification and the code inside the function would run only when it is called. See below example with output that illustrates this behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def fn(ka='faa'):\n",
    "    return ka\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output: no output it is just registered in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sa = fn()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sa)\n",

    "3. What statement creates a function? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def statement creates a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is basically a specification on set of instructions on how to execute the code and return some value whereas the function call would actually execute the code inside the function and aassign the return value to the variable or any other instance whereever it is called as per the specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Global scope would be only one in python and it would be throughout the program during execution.Local scope would be specific to each function or method and could be multiple based on number of functions or methods created in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable local scope would be ended once the function call returns the value and then if in case the variable is declared globally then the global scope would still be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of return value is to capture the output of the code in the function and assign it to the variable or other instance wherever it is called in runtime. Yes return value could be used in an expression. Below example illustrates this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def fn(ka='faa'):\n",
    "    return ka\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output: no output it is just registered in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sa = 'a' + fn()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sa)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "output: afaa\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value could be none if there is no return statement to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using global statement inside a function as below\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def abc():\n",
    "    global a    # Needed to modify global copy of global variable\n",
    "    a = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The None Datatype is used to define the null value or no value, the none value means not 0 or False value and it is a data of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic if in case that library is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to prefix with the module name to the bacon() feature as below\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import spam\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a = spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to use exception handling using try, except, else, finally clauses based on the requirement we have and could let our program execute successfully by logging the errors and without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try clause would try to execute its code block and if in case it encounters any error then it will pass on to except block to execute accordingly and log the exception."
