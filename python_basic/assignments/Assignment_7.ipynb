    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RE.compile() is used to generate regex objects. Further we can use various methods like match, search, findall etc to perform various match operations on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings are utilised in regex objects, because backslash is used generally very often in regular expression strings to escape special characters or metacharacters. But in python regular expression are not part of the language so they treated as string literals in which to escape the blackslash charater we need to use additional backslash charatcer. Rather mentioning these many backslash or any special treatment we can simply mention them as raw string by prefixing with r character.\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "search() method scans through a string, looking for any location where the regular expression matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the match pattern is at begining of the string then it returns the match string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "p = re.compile(r'\\d+' )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "m = p.match('drummers drumming 12, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "output: balnk output no match as digits are not at begining of the string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below code illustrates the group behaviour. group(0) returns full string match, group(1) returns first sub-group match (\\d\\d\\d) and group(2) returns second sub-group match (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",

    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By prefix with backslach nd embedd in raw string we can fit real parentheses and periods.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "string list is returned when there is no subgroup using parentheses in regular expression, whereas list of string tuples is return for matches found based  when there are sub-groups in the regular expression.\n",

    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard expressions | character is used for concatenating strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ means one or more character matching i.e. atleast one character match is required, whereas * means zero or more match i.e. even blank string is match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{4} denotes that preceeding character should repeat for 4 times then only there will be match whereas for {4,5} preceeding charaacter can repeat between 4 and 5 times to match.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".*? in this ? character makes the preceding quantifier lazy, causing it to match as few characters as possible. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".* here it tries to match in greedy way trying match all characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This flag allows you to write regular expressions that are more readable by granting you more flexibility in how you can format them, also we cana keep comments as required in regular expression string.\n",
